# EduVerse: AI-Generated Quests with Bounty Rewards: Do Quest via Game

EduVerse is a decentralized platform that empowers users to create engaging educational quests, deposit bounty tokens to incentivize players, and allow players to claim rewards upon completing the challenges. All interactions, including quest creation, bounty deposit, and reward claiming, are powered by blockchain and smart contract technology, ensuring transparency and security.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Quests**: Users can create quests automatically generated by AI based on provided themes, topics, or specific criteria. Each quest consists of a series of questions or tasks to be completed by players.
  
- **Bounty System**: Quest creators can deposit bounty tokens into a smart contract as a reward for players who successfully complete the quest. The bounty tokens are locked into the contract until the quest is completed.
  
- **Smart Contract Integration**: The platform utilizes smart contracts to handle the secure storage and distribution of bounty tokens. Players can only claim rewards after fulfilling all conditions of the quest.

- **Claim Rewards**: Players can claim their bounty rewards upon successfully completing a quest. Once a quest is completed and validated, the bounty tokens are automatically transferred to the player’s wallet.

## How It Works

### 1. **Creating a Quest**
   - Users (quest creators) enter a theme, topic, or specific set of parameters for their quest.
   - An AI engine generates a set of questions or tasks based on the provided input.
   - Creators can review and modify the generated content before finalizing the quest.

### 2. **Depositing Bounty Tokens**
   - After the quest is created, the creator deposits a specified amount of bounty tokens into the smart contract.
   - The bounty tokens are locked in the smart contract until the quest is completed by a player.

### 3. **Playing the Quest**
   - Players browse available quests and select one to participate in.
   - The player answers questions or completes tasks, as defined by the AI-generated quest.
   - Each quest has a set of conditions that need to be met in order to complete it.

### 4. **Claiming Rewards**
   - Once a player successfully completes a quest, the smart contract automatically validates the completion.
   - Upon validation, the player can claim the bounty tokens stored in the smart contract.
   - The tokens are transferred to the player’s wallet.

### 5. **Smart Contract Security**
   - All quests, bounty deposits, and rewards are managed through secure, transparent smart contracts on the blockchain.
   - The system ensures that bounty tokens are distributed only to players who have truly completed the quest according to the defined conditions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using **EduVerse**, make sure you have:
- A supported **EduChain** wallet (such as MetaMask).
- Some **EduChain** or another supported cryptocurrency in your wallet to pay for transaction fees (gas fees).
- Access to a decentralized application (DApp) browser, such as MetaMask or a Web3-enabled browser.

### How to Create a Quest

1. **Login**: Connect your **OpenEdu** chain & **Open Campus** to the **EduVerse** platform.
2. **Create Quest**: Click on "Create Quest" from the main dashboard. You’ll be prompted to provide a theme, topic, and other parameters.
3. **Review and Edit**: The AI will generate a set of questions or tasks for your quest. You can modify the content as needed.
4. **Deposit Bounty**: Specify the amount of bounty tokens you wish to deposit for the quest. You can use your wallet to deposit tokens directly into the smart contract.
5. **Publish**: Once you’re happy with the quest and the bounty is set, publish the quest for players to discover. This is done via the Smart Contract.

### How to Play a Quest

1. **Browse Available Quests**: Go to the "Quest List" and browse the available quests created by others, or use a direct link.
2. **Complete the Quest**: Answer questions, solve puzzles, or complete tasks to meet the completion criteria.
3. **Claim Your Bounty**: Once you finish the quest and your completion is validated, claim the bounty tokens stored in the smart contract.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- **All-in-One Contract**:
  - **Quest Storing**: All questions and metadata are stored via **IPFS**.
  - **Bounty Distribution**: The smart contract distributes tokens from the bounty pool to users who achieve good results.

### AI Engine

The AI engine is responsible for generating dynamic and engaging quests based on the inputs provided by the quest creators. The engine uses natural language processing (NLP) to create thematic questions and tasks that are relevant to the quest’s topic.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: **OpenEdu** (or other compatible blockchain for smart contract deployment).
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity for **OpenEdu**.
- **AI**: Natural language generation (NLG) and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for quest generation.
- **Frontend**: React.js, Web3.js for interacting with the **EduChain** blockchain.

## Roadmap

- **Q4 2024**: MVP Release – Basic quest creation and bounty deposit features.
- **Q1 2025**: AI Enhancements – Improve AI quest generation and personalization.
- **Q2 2025**: OpenEdu Mainnet Integration.
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile App Release – A mobile version of the **EduVerse** platform.
